# Triadic Context Engineering 12-Factor Agent Templates

This folder provides scaffolding for designing and running triadic AI engagements that align with context engineering and 12-factor agent principles. Each artifact keeps the user, Agentic A, and Agentic B in sync while preserving a lightweight implementation surface.

## Contents
- `triad-session.template.md`: shared session log for the user, Agentic A, and Agentic B.
- `context-bundle.template.json`: starter context bundle aligned with `schemas/context-contract.json`.
- `operating-guide.md`: quick-start checklist covering setup, execution, and hygiene.

## How to Use
1. Copy the templates into your project or mission folder.
2. Customize the placeholders for the specific triad, objectives, and tooling.
3. Keep the artifacts in version control; review after each session to enforce 12-factor discipline.
